# DP23 Allee Drive Modeling
 Modelling Genetic Allee Effects on expanding populations in SLiM. 
 1. Examining the survival rate on isolated founding population
 2. Examine the effect on wave velocity
 3. Examine the load generated from various release strategies.
 Later on a Genedrive that generates genetic load to cause the allee effect can be examined.
